<h1>FRANCOR - Frankonian Open Robotics</h1>
<h2>CAD - Computer Aided Design Data of Robots</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>
In this repository you can find the CAD data of all concepts and robots build
by the RoboCup Rescue Team FRANCOR.

<h3>Concepts</h3>

<h4>1. Concept: 8-Wheel Robot</h4>

The first meeting result in a concept of a 4 wheel drive robot based on the SummitXL Robot from Robotnik. The idea was to use 8 wheel hub drives to get enough power. This concept was quickly rejected, because it was to difficult to develop a cheap suspension. Furthermore the all-terrain mobility was not too good ( Problems with climbing stairs ).

<h4>2. Concept: 4-Wheel Robot</h4>

The second concept was a very simple platform with 4 wheels and no suspension. The idea was to first have a platform which can move ( even when the terrain mobility is very limited ) to set up the system and test software ( Sensors, PCs, ... ).

This kind of concept is the first which was build with simple aluminium profiles. But due to the fact, that the terrain mobility is very limited another concept was needed.

<h4>3. Concept: Rocker-Bogie Robot</h4>

The next concept is based on the rocker-bogie suspension used for many robots like the NASA Mars Rover Curiosity. The team decided to build a rescue robot based on this concept.
The benefits are a high terrain accesibility and a good compromise of simplicity and costs.

This concept is now under heavy development and can hopefully be built at end of the year 2017.

<h3>Current Progress</h3>

It was decided to move the suspension with angled profiles. This concept is now being worked out and the production of the components will start mid/end of December. The schedule provides for the mechanics to be assembled by the end of January.
